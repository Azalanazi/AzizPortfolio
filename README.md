 **- Fake News Detection - Text Analytics** This project involves detecting fake news in news articles. Labeled datasets, containing articles marked as "fake" or "real" news, are being worked on. An article from CNN Politics and political posts and news from Reddit has been obtained for analysis. The project is divided into two parts. First, the labeled dataset is analyzed and prepared to train and test supervised algorithms. Then, the same pre-trained algorithms are applied to the CNN Politics article and Reddit data to detect fake news. The goal is to identify fake news in these datasets and combat misinformation.

**- Twitter & Reddit data Analysis - NLP & Clustering:**  Users' comments from the Reddit app and tweets from Twitter were gathered and subjected to sentiment analysis and text clustering using K-means and Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms (HCA). The optimum number of clusters was identified, and the top 10 most frequent words were listed and visualized through word clouds. Valuable insights into user sentiments and content were gained from the analysis.
